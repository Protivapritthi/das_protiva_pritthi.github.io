  <h1>PROTIVA DAS</h1>
  <p>MSc Student | Researcher in HCI/NLP/Privacy</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a passionate researcher with a strong academic background in Computer Science. I completed both my BSc and MSc from BRAC University, Bangladesh, where I developed a deep interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Privacy. My MSc thesis, supervised by Professor Farig Yousuf Sadeque, explores the intersection of user-centered design and digital privacy in emerging technologies. I am currently based in Norfolk, Virginia, USA, and actively seeking PhD opportunities for Spring and Fall 2026.

Beyond academics, I enjoy immersing myself in travel documentaries and reading novels, which broaden my perspective and creativity. I am always eager to collaborate on impactful research that bridges technology and human experience.
